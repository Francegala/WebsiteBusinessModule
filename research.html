            I started by looking at other companies applications, and now I have a better knowledge on
            <br />
            User Experience: since I played with it and I can see how people interacts with the app and what to research more to know if people like the actual state or if they prefer something different. For example I can ask about position of buttons and usability.
            <br />
            User Interface: after using it for some days I can see the way colours, shapes and texts are used and from here it is possible to research more to know what people prefer in terms of what they see.

            During this period I read and researched about skills required to start a business successfully.
            <br />
            Guess what I discovered!?!....
            <br />
            There are no particular skills required!<br />
            Everyone can be entrepreneurial in some way. The only thing is to know what steps to do. <br />
            <br />For summarising:<br />
            1) Identify a problem and a target <br />
            2) Do your research, primary and secondary <br >
            3) Analyse your data to understand better the implications behind your issue <br />
            4) Know your competitors! <br />
            5) Remember that your idea needs a body (design, features) <br />
            6) Finance, think about a business plan and model! <br />
            7) People, you can do it but for sure you need a team! (talk about this later!) <br />
            <br /> Why am I telling you this? <br />
            Because I discovered that business and marketing is not simple but it can be done if you plan ahead and if you know wat to look for, that's the reason why I wrote that summary! <br />
            For sure you need to be creative to be able to invent and to self-reflect on what are your abilities and of course, have good ideas. <br />
            You also need competencies to analyse data and understand what people are telling you about your idea to understand feedback,<br />
            You need to be brave to take initiative in a complex and fast changing world and for this reason you also need to be flexible to change. <br />
            I not only discovered it but I also applied it in practice, when I approached people to ask their opinion or to fill a form for me. It happened that answers were not what expected so I changed my mind. <br />
            When asking people about a sensible topic like anxiety, somethimes I received answers that were denoting they were not at ease. In that case you need to do like me, find a way to make those questions more approachable using other words and asking less directly.
            The app also included not only university-related features but a timetable to organise hobbies and free time because it was something people required.<br />
            Moreover I with my team decided to focus less on using the app to provide activities to relax people because our customers made us notice that there are plenty of other similar apps and that students have no time to use them.
